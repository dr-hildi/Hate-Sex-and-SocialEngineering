  \begin{verse}
    Saw you from time to time \\
    on my way to work and home. \\

    these eyes so deep and occult. \\
    Today I invited you to a coffee at the corner. \\[2ex]

    Than I woke up again. \\

  \begin{verse}
    
    Long ago we had a tiff.\\

    Autumn gray, too cold to sleep outside. \\

    Warming words and warming food. \\
    I was proud to earn your thank... \\[2ex]

    Than I woke up again. \\
